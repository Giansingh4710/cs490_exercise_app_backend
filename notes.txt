1) Services folder : Needed?
2) DataAccess folder : 
  files named repo: can I change that to make it more accutate like requestsDB
  no try except in DB files, because the functions that call db will throw error
  getPendingRequests clean up less code like in unansweredRequestsByCoach_DB

3) routes name should start lowercase?

4) Servic/TokenVerification: can we move that to util/helper_func
    also made fakeVerifyToken
