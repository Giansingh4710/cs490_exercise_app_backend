from pattern i see you can only mock a function 2 times and then it will return the last value:
  db_file.insertDailySurvey_DB.mockImplementationOnce(() => {});
  like you can only over right this 1 more time and the 2nd time you try to do it, it will not run that function u wrote

  same with vars like:
    req.body.email = "wrongEmail";
    weird results when you try to over write it again


mockImplementation vs mockImplementationOnce
