from pattern i see you can only mock a function 2 times and then it will return the last value:
  db_file.insertDailySurvey_DB.mockImplementationOnce(() => {});
  like you can only over right this 1 more time and the 2nd time you try to do it, it will not run that function u wrote

  same with vars like:
    req.body.email = "wrongEmail";
    weird results when you try to over write it again


mockImplementation vs mockImplementationOnce

  
should only have constants on top. well they are constants
but the objects shouldn't be messed with, other wise just make the objs local (ex: req in each it block)
